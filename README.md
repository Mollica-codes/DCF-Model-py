## Running the Code
To begin, you need to get an api key from FMP. There is a free plan when you sign up. copy and paste the api key where it says at the top of the code.

Next run the code. First you will put in what company you want to model by typing the Stock Symbol (example: 'MSFT' for Microsoft). 

Next you will enter assumptions for the model. A few historical calculations and a Dataframe are provided to help

After you can select to export the model to excel. Select 'y' for yes or 'n' for no. If 'y' is entered, you will enter in the name of the file. Be sure to add .xlsx to the end.

An excel file will be created. The sheet will only have a pandas dataframe which is not very helpful for analysis

Add and run the macro taken from the txt file to format the sheet. The base model will be complete!
